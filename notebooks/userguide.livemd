# OpenaiEx User Guide

```elixir
Mix.install([
  #  {:openai_ex, git: "https://github.com/restlessronin/openai_ex.git", tag: "v0.2.3"},

```

## Introduction

`OpenaiEx` is an Elixir library that provides a community-maintained OpenAI API client especially for Livebook development.

At this point, all current API endpoints and features are supported, including the **streaming version of the completion and chat completion endpoints**.

There are some differences compared to other elixir openai wrappers.

* I tried to faithfully mirror the naming/structure of the official python api. For example, content that is already in memory can be uploaded as part of a request, it doesn't have to be read from a file at a local path.
* I was developing for a livebook use-case, so I don't have any config, only environment variables.
* Streaming API versions are fully supported.

To learn how to use OpenaiEx, you can refer to the relevant parts of the official OpenAI API reference documentation, which we link to throughout this document.

This file is an executable Livebook, which means you can interactively run and modify the code samples provided. We encourage you to open it in Livebook and try out the code for yourself!

## Installation

You can install OpenaiEx using Mix:

### In Livebook

Add the following code to the first connection cell:

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
Mix.install(
  [
    {:openai_ex, "~> 0.2.3"}
  ],
)
```

### In a Mix Project

Add the following to your mix.exs file:

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:openai_ex, "~> 0.2.3"}
  ]
end
```

## Authentication

To authenticate with the OpenAI API, you will need an API key. We recommend storing your API key in an environment variable. Since we are using Livebook, we can store this and other environment variables as [Livebook Hub Secrets](https://news.livebook.dev/hubs-and-secret-management---launch-week-1---day-3-3tMaJ2).

```elixir
apikey = System.fetch_env!("LB_OPENAI_API_KEY")
openai = OpenaiEx.new(apikey)
```

You can also specify an organization if you are a member of more than one:

```elixir
# organization = System.fetch_env!("LB_OPENAI_ORGANIZATION")
# openai = OpenaiEx.new(apikey, organization)
```

For more information on authentication, see the [OpenAI API Authentication reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/authentication).

## Model

### List Models

To list all available models, use the [`Model.list()`](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/models/list) function:

```elixir
alias OpenaiEx.Model

openai |> Model.list()
```

### Retrieve Models

To retrieve information about a specific model, use the [`Model.retrieve()`](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/models/retrieve) function:

```elixir
openai |> Model.retrieve("text-davinci-003")
```

For more information on using models, see the [OpenAI API Models reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/models).

## Completion

To generate a completion, you first need to define a completion request structure using the `Completion.new()` function. This function takes several parameters, such as the model ID, the prompt, the maximum number of tokens, etc.

```elixir
alias OpenaiEx.Completion

completion_req =
  Completion.new(
    model: "text-davinci-003",
    prompt:
      "Give me some background on the elixir language. Why was it created? What is it used for? What distinguishes it from other languages? How popular is it?",
    max_tokens: 500,
    temperature: 0
  )
```

Once you have defined the completion request structure, you can generate a completion using the [`Completion.create()`](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/create) function:

```elixir
comp_response = openai |> Completion.create(completion_req)
```

You can also call the endpoint and have it return a stream. This returns the result as a series of tokens, which have to be put together in code.

To use the stream option, call the `Completion.create()` function with `stream: true`

```elixir
completion_stream = openai |> Completion.create(completion_req, stream: true)

completion_stream |> Stream.flat_map(& &1) |> Enum.each(fn x -> IO.puts(inspect(x)) end)
```

For an example of how to programmatically work with this stream, check out the [Completions Bot livebook](https://hexdocs.pm/openai_ex/completions.html) which builds a ChatBot UI using the Completion API (with and without streaming).

For more information on generating completions, see the [OpenAI API Completions reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions).

## Chat Completion

To generate a chat completion, you need to define a chat completion request structure using the `ChatCompletion.new()` function. This function takes several parameters, such as the model ID and a list of chat messages. We have a module `ChatMessage` which helps create messages in the [chat format](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat/introduction).

```elixir
alias OpenaiEx.ChatCompletion
alias OpenaiEx.ChatMessage

chat_req =
  ChatCompletion.new(
    model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages: [
      ChatMessage.user(
        "Give me some background on the elixir language. Why was it created? What is it used for? What distinguishes it from other languages? How popular is it?"
      )
    ]
  )
```

You can generate a chat completion using the [`ChatCompletion.create()`](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/completions/create) function:

```elixir
chat_response = openai |> ChatCompletion.create(chat_req)
```

You can also call the endpoint and have it stream the response. This returns the result as a series of tokens, which have to be put together in code.

To use the stream option, call the `ChatCompletion.create()` function with `stream: true`

```elixir
chat_stream = openai |> ChatCompletion.create(chat_req, stream: true)

chat_stream |> Stream.flat_map(& &1) |> Enum.each(fn x -> IO.puts(inspect(x)) end)
```

For a more in-depth example of `ChatCompletion`, check out the [Deeplearning.AI OrderBot Livebook](https://hexdocs.pm/openai_ex/dlai_orderbot.html).

For a detailed example of the use of the streaming `ChatCompletion` API, check out [Streaming Orderbot](https://hexdocs.pm/openai_ex/streaming_orderbot.html), the streaming equivalent of the prior example.

For more information on generating chat completions, see the [OpenAI API Chat Completions reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat).

## Edit

First you need to define an edit request structure using the `Edit.new()` function. This function takes several parameters, such as the model ID, an input and an instruction.

```elixir
alias OpenaiEx.Edit

edit_req =
  Edit.new(
    model: "text-davinci-edit-001",
    input: "What day of the wek is it?",
    instruction: "Fix the spelling mistakes"
  )
```

To generate the edit, call the [`Edit.create()`](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/edits) function.

```elixir
edit_response = openai |> Edit.create(edit_req)
```

For more information on generating edits, see the [OpenAI API Edit reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/edits).

## Image

### Generate Image

We define the image creation request structure using the `Image.new` function

```elixir
alias OpenaiEx.Image

img_req = Image.new(prompt: "A cute baby sea otter", size: "256x256", n: 2)
```

Then call the [`Image.create()`](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/images/create) function to generate the images.

```elixir
img_response = openai |> Image.create(img_req)
```

For more information on generating images, see the [OpenAI API Image reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/images).

#### Fetch the generated images

With the information in the image response, we can fetch the images from their URLs

```elixir
fetch_blob = fn url ->
  Finch.build(:get, url) |> Finch.request!(OpenaiEx.Finch) |> Map.get(:body)
end
```

```elixir
fetched_images = img_response["data"] |> Enum.map(fn i -> i["url"] |> fetch_blob.() end)
```

#### View the generated images

Finally, we can render the images using Kino

```elixir
fetched_images
|> Enum.map(fn r -> r |> Kino.Image.new("image/png") |> Kino.render() end)
```

```elixir
img_to_expmt = fetched_images |> List.first()
```

### Edit Image

We define an image edit request structure using the `Image.Edit.new()` function. This function requires an image and a mask. For the image, we will use the one that we received. Let's load the mask from a URL.

```elixir
star_mask =
  fetch_blob.(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/restlessronin/openai_ex/main/assets/images/starmask.png"
  )

# star_mask = OpenaiEx.new_file(path: Path.join(__DIR__, "../assets/images/starmask.png"))
```

Set up the image edit request with image, mask and prompt.

```elixir
img_edit_req =
  Image.Edit.new(
    image: img_to_expmt,
    mask: star_mask,
    size: "256x256",
    prompt: "Image shows a smiling Otter"
  )
```

We then call the [`Image.create_edit()`]() function

```elixir
img_edit_response = openai |> Image.create_edit(img_edit_req)
```

and view the result

```elixir
img_edit_response["data"]
|> Enum.map(fn i -> i["url"] |> fetch_blob.() |> Kino.Image.new("image/png") |> Kino.render() end)
```

### Image Variations

We define an image variation request structure using the `Image.Variation.new()` function. This function requires an image.

```elixir
img_var_req = Image.Variation.new(image: img_to_expmt, size: "256x256")
```

Then call the [`Image.create_variation()`](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/images/create-variation) function to generate the images.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

###

```elixir
img_var_response = openai |> Image.create_variation(img_var_req)
```

```elixir
img_var_response["data"]
|> Enum.map(fn i -> i["url"] |> fetch_blob.() |> Kino.Image.new("image/png") |> Kino.render() end)
```

For more information on images variations, see the [OpenAI API Image Variations reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/images/create-variation).

## Embedding

Define the embedding request structure using `Embedding.new`.

```elixir
alias OpenaiEx.Embedding

emb_req =
  Embedding.new(
    model: "text-embedding-ada-002",
    input: "The food was delicious and the waiter..."
  )
```

Then call the [`Embedding.create()`]() function.

```elixir
emb_response = openai |> Embedding.create(emb_req)
```

For more information on generating embeddings, see the [OpenAI API Embedding reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/embeddings/create)

## Audio

### Transcription

To define an Audio request structure, we need to create a file parameter using `Audio.File.new()`.

```elixir
alias OpenaiEx.Audio

audio_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/restlessronin/openai_ex/main/assets/transcribe.mp3"

audio_file = OpenaiEx.new_file(name: audio_url, content: fetch_blob.(audio_url))

# audio_file = OpenaiEx.new_file(path: Path.join(__DIR__, "../assets/transcribe.mp3"))
```

The file parameter is used to create the Audio request structure

```elixir
audio_req = Audio.new(file: audio_file, model: "whisper-1")
```

We then call the [`Audio.transcribe()`](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/audio/create) function to create a transcription.

```elixir
audio_response = openai |> Audio.transcribe(audio_req)
```

### Translation

The translation call uses practically the same request structure, but calls the `Audio.translate()` endpoint

For more information on the audio endpoints see the [Openai API Audio Reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/audio)

## File

### List files

To request all files that belong to the user organization, call the [`File.list()`](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/files/list) function

```elixir
alias OpenaiEx.File

openai |> File.list()
```

### Upload files

To upload a file, we need to create a file parameter, and then the upload request

```elixir
# fine_tune_file = OpenaiEx.new_file(path: Path.join(__DIR__, "../assets/fine-tune.jsonl"))
ftf_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/restlessronin/openai_ex/main/assets/fine-tune.jsonl"

fine_tune_file = OpenaiEx.new_file(name: ftf_url, content: fetch_blob.(ftf_url))
upload_req = File.new_upload(file: fine_tune_file, purpose: "fine-tune")
```

Then we call the [`File.create()`](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/files/upload) function to upload the file

```elixir
upload_res = openai |> File.create(upload_req)
```

We can verify that the file has been uploaded by calling

```elixir
openai |> File.list()
```

We grab the file id from the previous response value to use in the following samples

```elixir
file_id = upload_res["id"]
```

### Retrieve files

In order to retrieve meta information on a file, we simply call the [`File.retrieve()`]() function with the given id

```elixir
openai |> File.retrieve(file_id)
```

### Retrieve file content

Similarly to download the file contents, we call [`File.download()`]()

```elixir
openai |> File.download(file_id)
```

### Delete file

Finally, we can delete the file by calling [`File.delete()`](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/files/delete)

```elixir
openai |> File.delete(file_id)
```

Verify that the file has been deleted by listing files again

```elixir
openai |> File.list()
```

## FineTune

To run a fine-tune, we minimally need a training file. We will re-run the file creation request above.

```elixir
upload_res = openai |> File.create(upload_req)
```

Next we call `FineTune.new()` to create a new request structure

```elixir
alias OpenaiEx.FineTune

ft_req = FineTune.new(training_file: upload_res["id"])
```

To begin the fine tune, we call the [`FineTune.create()`](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/fine-tunes/create) function

```elixir
ft_res = openai |> FineTune.create(ft_req)
```

We can list all fine tunes by calling [`FineTune.list()`](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/fine-tunes/list)

```elixir
openai |> FineTune.list()
```

The function [`FineTune.retrieve()`](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/fine-tunes/retrieve) gets the details of a particular fine tune.

```elixir
ft_id = ft_res["id"]
openai |> FineTune.retrieve(fine_tune_id: ft_id)
```

and [`FineTune.list_events()`](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/fine-tunes/events) can be called to get the events

```elixir
openai |> FineTune.list_events(fine_tune_id: ft_id)
```

To cancel a Fine Tune job, call [`FineTune.cancel()`](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/fine-tunes/cancel)

```elixir
openai |> FineTune.cancel(fine_tune_id: ft_id)
```

A fine tuned model can be deleted by calling the [`Model.delete()`](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/fine-tunes/delete-model)

```elixir
ft_model = ft_res["fine_tuned_model"]

unless is_nil(ft_model) do
  openai |> Model.delete(ft_model)
end
```

For more information on the fine tune endpoints see the [Openai API Moderation Reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/fine-tunes)

## Moderation

We use the moderation API by calling `Moderation.new()` to create a new request

```elixir
alias OpenaiEx.Moderation

mod_req = Moderation.new(input: "I want to kill people")
```

The call the function [`Moderation.create()`](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/moderations/create)

```elixir
mod_res = openai |> Moderation.create(mod_req)
```

For more information on the moderation endpoints see the [Openai API Moderation Reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/moderations)
