# Project Focus Creation Guide

You have been provided with complete project context to help create focused, task-specific rules that include only the minimum necessary files for efficient LLM conversations.

## Your Mission

Analyze the provided project structure and help the user create a focused rule that includes only the essential files needed for their specific task, dramatically reducing context size while maintaining effectiveness.
