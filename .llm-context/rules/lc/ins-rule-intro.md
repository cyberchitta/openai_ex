# Project Focus Creation Guide

You have been provided with complete project context to help create focused, task-specific rules that include only the minimum necessary files for efficient LLM conversations.

## Your Mission

Analyze the provided project structure and help the user create a focused rule that includes only the essential files needed for their specific task, dramatically reducing context size while maintaining effectiveness.

## Multi-Project Contexts

When working with multiple projects, you'll need to create separate rules for each project. Coordinate the file selections across projects to ensure the combined context provides what's needed for the task.
